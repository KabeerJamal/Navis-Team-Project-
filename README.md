# Navis â€“ Browser-based IDE for Zephyr Firmware

## Project Overview
Navis is a browser-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) built to simplify firmware development for Zephyr RTOS projects. Firmware development often involves complex local build environments, dependency management, and toolchain setup, which can cause inconsistencies and slow down development. Navis addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Web-based access:** Developers can manage projects, write code, and trigger builds entirely from a browser, without installing any software locally.  
- **Consistent builds:** Builds are executed inside containerized environments, ensuring reproducibility across machines and operating systems.  
- **Project management tools:** Users can organize multiple projects, track files, and manage builds through an intuitive dashboard.  
- **Integrated code editing:** A browser-based code editor (VS Code Web) allows file navigation, syntax highlighting, and smooth coding workflows.  
- **Output access:** Build logs and compiled binaries are easily accessible for inspection and download.

This approach removes environment setup complexities, reduces errors caused by inconsistent builds, and allows teams to focus on writing firmware rather than managing development tools. Navis also supports secure collaboration and is easily scalable for larger firmware projects.

## My Contributions
- Worked in a 10-member team to develop the browser-based IDE.  
- Learned **React** and contributed to frontend skeleton code.  
- Implemented **Redux logic** for project management (actions, dispatch, slices).  
- Contributed to backend API endpoints and database schema extensions.
- Contributed to a VS Code Web extension that uses WebDAV to perform backend file operations.
- Coordinated between documentation and technical teams to ensure consistency.

**Technologies:** React, Redux, Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, WebDAV, Docker
